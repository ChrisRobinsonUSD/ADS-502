The data set being used for this project contains data on the weather in different cities in Australia, which
was found on a Kaggle competition page. There are 23 variables within the data set and each row is a
different date corresponding to a certain location. The data set has 10 years of weather information, ranging
from the minimum and maximum temperature of the day to the pressure and the humidity. In total, there
are 145,460 rows (not including the header) and 23 columns.

The purpose of this project is to predict the target variable ‘RainTomorrow’ in the data set ‘weatherAUS’
using classification models. ‘RainTomorrow’ is a binary feature taking the values ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. The rainfall
must be more than 1mm for the ‘RainToday’ (another binary feature in the data which states if rain happened
on a specific day or not) and ‘RainTomorrow’ variables to be ‘Yes’. The objective is to use different data
cleaning methods, data prepping methods, and predictive modeling strategies learned this semester and
apply them to this data set.
